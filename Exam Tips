• Schedule your exam based on how many hours you can work without getting too tired
• Take frequent breaks (once every 2 hours)
• 2-hour rule for moving on
• Take frequent breaks
• Schedule your exam as early as possible (convenient time slots fill up quickly)
• Avoid "rabbit holes"
• If a password is not in rockyou.txt, you probably won't be able to crack it (although the exam guide says that technically, it could be a password from one of the lists in Kali Linux, so if you're paranoid, you can look through /usr/share/seclists).
	• For OFFLINE password cracking, you don't need to go through the whole rockyou file (that will take too long). If you don't get it in the first few minutes, try something else. For cases where you don't plan on using the entire password list, hydra has the -u flag that iterates each password over all usernames before moving on to the next password
		○  Also you can use /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-15.txt (first 250 passwords of rockyou.txt)
• The grader must be able to follow how you did everything. This means take a ton of screenshots (better too many than too few). Missing a single screenshot can be the difference between passing and failing. Additionally, if you have trouble with a box and decide to return to it later, you will thank yourself if you took good screenshots.
• msfconsole can be used on 1 machine only, so choose carefully. Ideally, leave it for when you're down to the last box that you need to pass the exam.

• <Exam Report template>
	• Note: You can emit sections of the template if they are not listed in the report requirements (for example, you don’t need a ”persistence” section).
